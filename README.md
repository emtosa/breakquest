# Break Quest

An ADHD focus + break game by [Foculoom](https://foculoom.com).

## Concept

Work sessions become quests. Breaks become micro-adventures. Complete a breathing exercise during your break and your hero explores a tiny room to find loot (cosmetic only).

## How It Works

1. **Press Embark** → 25-minute focus session begins (🧙 hero goes adventuring)
2. **Session complete** → break phase unlocks the mini-game 🌿
3. **Breathe** → Inhale 4s → Hold 2s → Exhale 4s (repeat)
4. **Complete 2 cycles** → loot chest unlocks (random cosmetic item 🪙)
5. **Break ends** → return to focus with your loot displayed

## Loot Pool

🗡️ ⚔️ 🛡️ 👑 💎 🪄 🏺 🔮 🪙 🧿

All cosmetic — displayed in your hero's inventory room during breaks.

## Science

The 4-2-4 breathing pattern (box breathing variant) activates the parasympathetic nervous system — ideal for ADHD brains transitioning back to focus.
